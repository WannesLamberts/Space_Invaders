There are myriads of \href{http://json.org}{\texttt{ J\+S\+ON}} libraries out there, and each may even have its reason to exist. Our class had these design goals\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\bfseries{Intuitive syntax}}. In languages such as Python, J\+S\+ON feels like a first class data type. We used all the operator magic of modern C++ to achieve the same feeling in your code. Check out the \href{\#examples}{\texttt{ examples below}} and you\textquotesingle{}ll know what I mean.
\item {\bfseries{Trivial integration}}. Our whole code consists of a single header file \href{https://github.com/nlohmann/json/blob/develop/single_include/nlohmann/json.hpp}{\texttt{ {\ttfamily json.\+hpp}}}. That\textquotesingle{}s it. No library, no subproject, no dependencies, no complex build system. The class is written in vanilla C++11. All in all, everything should require no adjustment of your compiler flags or project settings.
\item {\bfseries{Serious testing}}. Our class is heavily \href{https://github.com/nlohmann/json/tree/develop/test/src}{\texttt{ unit-\/tested}} and covers \href{https://coveralls.io/r/nlohmann/json}{\texttt{ 100\%}} of the code, including all exceptional behavior. Furthermore, we checked with \href{http://valgrind.org}{\texttt{ Valgrind}} and the \href{https://clang.llvm.org/docs/index.html}{\texttt{ Clang Sanitizers}} that there are no memory leaks. \href{https://github.com/google/oss-fuzz/tree/master/projects/json}{\texttt{ Google O\+S\+S-\/\+Fuzz}} additionally runs fuzz tests against all parsers 24/7, effectively executing billions of tests so far. To maintain high quality, the project is following the \href{https://bestpractices.coreinfrastructure.org/projects/289}{\texttt{ Core Infrastructure Initiative (C\+II) best practices}}.
\end{DoxyItemize}

Other aspects were not so important to us\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\bfseries{Memory efficiency}}. Each J\+S\+ON object has an overhead of one pointer (the maximal size of a union) and one enumeration element (1 byte). The default generalization uses the following C++ data types\+: {\ttfamily std\+::string} for strings, {\ttfamily int64\+\_\+t}, {\ttfamily uint64\+\_\+t} or {\ttfamily double} for numbers, {\ttfamily std\+::map} for objects, {\ttfamily std\+::vector} for arrays, and {\ttfamily bool} for Booleans. However, you can template the generalized class {\ttfamily basic\+\_\+json} to your needs.
\item {\bfseries{Speed}}. There are certainly \href{https://github.com/miloyip/nativejson-benchmark\#parsing-time}{\texttt{ faster J\+S\+ON libraries}} out there. However, if your goal is to speed up your development by adding J\+S\+ON support with a single header, then this library is the way to go. If you know how to use a {\ttfamily std\+::vector} or {\ttfamily std\+::map}, you are already set.
\end{DoxyItemize}

Thanks everyone!\hypertarget{md_json-develop_README_autotoc_md139}{}\doxysubsection{Integration}\label{md_json-develop_README_autotoc_md139}
\href{https://github.com/nlohmann/json/blob/develop/single_include/nlohmann/json.hpp}{\texttt{ {\ttfamily json.\+hpp}}} is the single required file in {\ttfamily single\+\_\+include/nlohmann} or \href{https://github.com/nlohmann/json/releases}{\texttt{ released here}}. You need to add


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{\textcolor{preprocessor}{\#include <nlohmann/json.hpp>}}
\DoxyCodeLine{}
\DoxyCodeLine{\textcolor{comment}{// for convenience}}
\DoxyCodeLine{\textcolor{keyword}{using} \mbox{\hyperlink{classnlohmann_1_1basic__json}{json}} = \mbox{\hyperlink{namespacenlohmann_a9cc9a3033850a092f791d86854d117fc}{nlohmann::json}};}
\end{DoxyCode}


to the files you want to process J\+S\+ON and set the necessary switches to enable C++11 (e.\+g., {\ttfamily -\/std=c++11} for G\+CC and Clang).

You can further use file \href{https://github.com/nlohmann/json/blob/develop/include/nlohmann/json_fwd.hpp}{\texttt{ {\ttfamily include/nlohmann/json\+\_\+fwd.\+hpp}}} for forward-\/declarations. The installation of \mbox{\hyperlink{json__fwd_8hpp_source}{json\+\_\+fwd.\+hpp}} (as part of cmake\textquotesingle{}s install step), can be achieved by setting {\ttfamily -\/D\+J\+S\+O\+N\+\_\+\+Multiple\+Headers=ON}.\hypertarget{md_json-develop_README_autotoc_md140}{}\doxysubsubsection{C\+Make}\label{md_json-develop_README_autotoc_md140}
You can also use the {\ttfamily nlohmann\+\_\+json\+::nlohmann\+\_\+json} interface target in C\+Make. This target populates the appropriate usage requirements for {\ttfamily I\+N\+T\+E\+R\+F\+A\+C\+E\+\_\+\+I\+N\+C\+L\+U\+D\+E\+\_\+\+D\+I\+R\+E\+C\+T\+O\+R\+I\+ES} to point to the appropriate include directories and {\ttfamily I\+N\+T\+E\+R\+F\+A\+C\+E\+\_\+\+C\+O\+M\+P\+I\+L\+E\+\_\+\+F\+E\+A\+T\+U\+R\+ES} for the necessary C++11 flags.\hypertarget{md_json-develop_README_autotoc_md141}{}\doxyparagraph{External}\label{md_json-develop_README_autotoc_md141}
To use this library from a C\+Make project, you can locate it directly with {\ttfamily find\+\_\+package()} and use the namespaced imported target from the generated package configuration\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{\# CMakeLists.txt}
\DoxyCodeLine{find\_package(nlohmann\_json 3.2.0 REQUIRED)}
\DoxyCodeLine{...}
\DoxyCodeLine{add\_library(foo ...)}
\DoxyCodeLine{...}
\DoxyCodeLine{target\_link\_libraries(foo PRIVATE nlohmann\_json::nlohmann\_json)}
\end{DoxyCode}


The package configuration file, {\ttfamily nlohmann\+\_\+json\+Config.\+cmake}, can be used either from an install tree or directly out of the build tree.\hypertarget{md_json-develop_README_autotoc_md142}{}\doxyparagraph{Embedded}\label{md_json-develop_README_autotoc_md142}
To embed the library directly into an existing C\+Make project, place the entire source tree in a subdirectory and call {\ttfamily add\+\_\+subdirectory()} in your {\ttfamily C\+Make\+Lists.\+txt} file\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{\# Typically you don't care so much for a third party library's tests to be}
\DoxyCodeLine{\# run from your own project's code.}
\DoxyCodeLine{set(JSON\_BuildTests OFF CACHE INTERNAL "")}
\DoxyCodeLine{}
\DoxyCodeLine{\# If you only include this third party in PRIVATE source files, you do not}
\DoxyCodeLine{\# need to install it when your main project gets installed.}
\DoxyCodeLine{\# set(JSON\_Install OFF CACHE INTERNAL "")}
\DoxyCodeLine{}
\DoxyCodeLine{\# Don't use include(nlohmann\_json/CMakeLists.txt) since that carries with it}
\DoxyCodeLine{\# unintended consequences that will break the build.  It's generally}
\DoxyCodeLine{\# discouraged (although not necessarily well documented as such) to use}
\DoxyCodeLine{\# include(...) for pulling in other CMake projects anyways.}
\DoxyCodeLine{add\_subdirectory(nlohmann\_json)}
\DoxyCodeLine{...}
\DoxyCodeLine{add\_library(foo ...)}
\DoxyCodeLine{...}
\DoxyCodeLine{target\_link\_libraries(foo PRIVATE nlohmann\_json::nlohmann\_json)}
\end{DoxyCode}
\hypertarget{md_json-develop_README_autotoc_md143}{}\doxyparagraph{Supporting Both}\label{md_json-develop_README_autotoc_md143}
To allow your project to support either an externally supplied or an embedded J\+S\+ON library, you can use a pattern akin to the following\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{\# Top level CMakeLists.txt}
\DoxyCodeLine{project(FOO)}
\DoxyCodeLine{...}
\DoxyCodeLine{option(FOO\_USE\_EXTERNAL\_JSON "Use an external JSON library" OFF)}
\DoxyCodeLine{...}
\DoxyCodeLine{add\_subdirectory(thirdparty)}
\DoxyCodeLine{...}
\DoxyCodeLine{add\_library(foo ...)}
\DoxyCodeLine{...}
\DoxyCodeLine{\# Note that the namespaced target will always be available regardless of the}
\DoxyCodeLine{\# import method}
\DoxyCodeLine{target\_link\_libraries(foo PRIVATE nlohmann\_json::nlohmann\_json)}
\end{DoxyCode}



\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{\# thirdparty/CMakeLists.txt}
\DoxyCodeLine{...}
\DoxyCodeLine{if(FOO\_USE\_EXTERNAL\_JSON)}
\DoxyCodeLine{  find\_package(nlohmann\_json 3.2.0 REQUIRED)}
\DoxyCodeLine{else()}
\DoxyCodeLine{  set(JSON\_BuildTests OFF CACHE INTERNAL "")}
\DoxyCodeLine{  add\_subdirectory(nlohmann\_json)}
\DoxyCodeLine{endif()}
\DoxyCodeLine{...}
\end{DoxyCode}


{\ttfamily thirdparty/nlohmann\+\_\+json} is then a complete copy of this source tree.\hypertarget{md_json-develop_README_autotoc_md144}{}\doxysubsubsection{Package Managers}\label{md_json-develop_README_autotoc_md144}
\+:beer\+: If you are using OS X and \href{http://brew.sh}{\texttt{ Homebrew}}, just type {\ttfamily brew tap nlohmann/json} and {\ttfamily brew install nlohmann-\/json} and you\textquotesingle{}re set. If you want the bleeding edge rather than the latest release, use {\ttfamily brew install nlohmann-\/json -\/-\/H\+E\+AD}.

If you are using the \href{http://mesonbuild.com}{\texttt{ Meson Build System}}, add this source tree as a \href{https://mesonbuild.com/Subprojects.html\#using-a-subproject}{\texttt{ meson subproject}}. You may also use the {\ttfamily include.\+zip} published in this project\textquotesingle{}s \href{https://github.com/nlohmann/json/releases}{\texttt{ Releases}} to reduce the size of the vendored source tree. Alternatively, you can get a wrap file by downloading it from \href{https://wrapdb.mesonbuild.com/nlohmann_json}{\texttt{ Meson Wrap\+DB}}, or simply use {\ttfamily meson wrap install nlohmann\+\_\+json}. Please see the meson project for any issues regarding the packaging.

The provided meson.\+build can also be used as an alternative to cmake for installing {\ttfamily nlohmann\+\_\+json} system-\/wide in which case a pkg-\/config file is installed. To use it, simply have your build system require the {\ttfamily nlohmann\+\_\+json} pkg-\/config dependency. In Meson, it is preferred to use the \href{https://mesonbuild.com/Reference-manual.html\#dependency}{\texttt{ {\ttfamily dependency()}}} object with a subproject fallback, rather than using the subproject directly.

If you are using \href{https://www.conan.io/}{\texttt{ Conan}} to manage your dependencies, merely add {\ttfamily nlohmann\+\_\+json/x.\+y.\+z} to your {\ttfamily conanfile}\textquotesingle{}s requires, where {\ttfamily x.\+y.\+z} is the release version you want to use. Please file issues \href{https://github.com/conan-io/conan-center-index/issues}{\texttt{ here}} if you experience problems with the packages.

If you are using \href{https://www.spack.io/}{\texttt{ Spack}} to manage your dependencies, you can use the \href{https://spack.readthedocs.io/en/latest/package_list.html\#nlohmann-json}{\texttt{ {\ttfamily nlohmann-\/json} package}}. Please see the \href{https://github.com/spack/spack}{\texttt{ spack project}} for any issues regarding the packaging.

Please see the vcpkg project for any issues regarding the packaging.

If you are using \href{http://cget.readthedocs.io/en/latest/}{\texttt{ cget}}, you can install the latest development version with {\ttfamily cget install nlohmann/json}. A specific version can be installed with {\ttfamily cget install nlohmann/json@v3.\+1.\+0}. Also, the multiple header version can be installed by adding the {\ttfamily -\/D\+J\+S\+O\+N\+\_\+\+Multiple\+Headers=ON} flag (i.\+e., {\ttfamily cget install nlohmann/json -\/D\+J\+S\+O\+N\+\_\+\+Multiple\+Headers=ON}).

If you are using \href{https://cocoapods.org}{\texttt{ Cocoa\+Pods}}, you can use the library by adding pod `\char`\"{}nlohmann\+\_\+json\char`\"{}, '$\sim$$>$3.\+1.\+2\textquotesingle{}\`{} to your podfile (see \href{https://bitbucket.org/benman/nlohmann_json-cocoapod/src/master/}{\texttt{ an example}}).

Here are some examples to give you an idea how to use the class.

Assume you want to create the J\+S\+ON object


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{\{}
\DoxyCodeLine{  "pi": 3.141,}
\DoxyCodeLine{  "happy": true,}
\DoxyCodeLine{  "name": "Niels",}
\DoxyCodeLine{  "nothing": null,}
\DoxyCodeLine{  "answer": \{}
\DoxyCodeLine{    "everything": 42}
\DoxyCodeLine{  \},}
\DoxyCodeLine{  "list": [1, 0, 2],}
\DoxyCodeLine{  "object": \{}
\DoxyCodeLine{    "currency": "USD",}
\DoxyCodeLine{    "value": 42.99}
\DoxyCodeLine{  \}}
\DoxyCodeLine{\}}
\end{DoxyCode}


With this library, you could write\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{\textcolor{comment}{// create an empty structure (null)}}
\DoxyCodeLine{\mbox{\hyperlink{classnlohmann_1_1basic__json}{json}} j;}
\DoxyCodeLine{}

\DoxyCodeLine{\textcolor{comment}{// add a Boolean that is stored as bool}}
\DoxyCodeLine{j[\textcolor{stringliteral}{"happy"}] = \textcolor{keyword}{true};}
\DoxyCodeLine{}
\DoxyCodeLine{\textcolor{comment}{// add a string that is stored as std::string}}
\DoxyCodeLine{j[\textcolor{stringliteral}{"name"}] = \textcolor{stringliteral}{"Niels"};}
\DoxyCodeLine{}
\DoxyCodeLine{\textcolor{comment}{// add another null object by passing nullptr}}
\DoxyCodeLine{j[\textcolor{stringliteral}{"nothing"}] = \textcolor{keyword}{nullptr};}
\DoxyCodeLine{}
\DoxyCodeLine{\textcolor{comment}{// add an object inside the object}}
\DoxyCodeLine{j[\textcolor{stringliteral}{"answer"}][\textcolor{stringliteral}{"everything"}] = 42;}
\DoxyCodeLine{}
\DoxyCodeLine{\textcolor{comment}{// add an array that is stored as std::vector (using an initializer list)}}
\DoxyCodeLine{j[\textcolor{stringliteral}{"list"}] = \{ 1, 0, 2 \};}
\DoxyCodeLine{}
\DoxyCodeLine{\textcolor{comment}{// add another object (using an initializer list of pairs)}}
\DoxyCodeLine{j[\textcolor{stringliteral}{"object"}] = \{ \{\textcolor{stringliteral}{"currency"}, \textcolor{stringliteral}{"USD"}\}, \{\textcolor{stringliteral}{"value"}, 42.99\} \};}
\DoxyCodeLine{}
\DoxyCodeLine{\textcolor{comment}{// instead, you could also write (which looks very similar to the JSON above)}}
\DoxyCodeLine{\mbox{\hyperlink{classnlohmann_1_1basic__json}{json}} j2 = \{}
\DoxyCodeLine{  \{\textcolor{stringliteral}{"pi"}, 3.141\},}
\DoxyCodeLine{  \{\textcolor{stringliteral}{"happy"}, \textcolor{keyword}{true}\},}
\DoxyCodeLine{  \{\textcolor{stringliteral}{"name"}, \textcolor{stringliteral}{"Niels"}\},}
\DoxyCodeLine{  \{\textcolor{stringliteral}{"nothing"}, \textcolor{keyword}{nullptr}\},}
\DoxyCodeLine{  \{\textcolor{stringliteral}{"answer"}, \{}
\DoxyCodeLine{    \{\textcolor{stringliteral}{"everything"}, 42\}}

\DoxyCodeLine{    \{\textcolor{stringliteral}{"value"}, 42.99\}}
\DoxyCodeLine{  \}\}}
\DoxyCodeLine{\};}
\end{DoxyCode}


Note that in all these cases, you never need to \char`\"{}tell\char`\"{} the compiler which J\+S\+ON value type you want to use.

You can create a J\+S\+ON value (deserialization) by appending {\ttfamily \+\_\+json} to a string literal\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{\textcolor{comment}{// create object from string literal}}
\DoxyCodeLine{\mbox{\hyperlink{classnlohmann_1_1basic__json}{json}} j = \textcolor{stringliteral}{"\{ \(\backslash\)"happy\(\backslash\)": true, \(\backslash\)"pi\(\backslash\)": 3.141 \}"}\_json;}
\DoxyCodeLine{}
\DoxyCodeLine{\textcolor{comment}{// or even nicer with a raw string literal}}
\DoxyCodeLine{\textcolor{keyword}{auto} j2 = R\textcolor{stringliteral}{"(}}
\DoxyCodeLine{\textcolor{stringliteral}{  \{}}
\DoxyCodeLine{\textcolor{stringliteral}{    "happy": true,}}
\DoxyCodeLine{\textcolor{stringliteral}{    "pi": 3.141}}
\DoxyCodeLine{\textcolor{stringliteral}{  \}}}
\DoxyCodeLine{\textcolor{stringliteral}{)"\_json;}}
\end{DoxyCode}


Note that without appending the {\ttfamily \+\_\+json} suffix, the passed string literal is not parsed, but just used as J\+S\+ON string value. That is, {\ttfamily json j = \char`\"{}\{ \textbackslash{}\char`\"{}happy"\+: true, "pi"\+: 3.\+141 \}\char`\"{}$<$/tt$>$ would just store the string $<$tt$>$\char`\"{}\{ \char`\"{}happy\char`\"{}\+: true, \char`\"{}pi\char`\"{}\+: 3.\+141 \}"} rather than parsing the actual object.

The above example can also be expressed explicitly using \href{https://nlohmann.github.io/json/classnlohmann_1_1basic__json_afd4ef1ac8ad50a5894a9afebca69140a.html\#afd4ef1ac8ad50a5894a9afebca69140a}{\texttt{ {\ttfamily json\+::parse()}}}\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{\textcolor{comment}{// parse explicitly}}
\DoxyCodeLine{\textcolor{keyword}{auto} j3 = \mbox{\hyperlink{classnlohmann_1_1basic__json_a265a473e939184aa42655c9ccdf34e58}{json::parse}}(\textcolor{stringliteral}{"\{ \(\backslash\)"happy\(\backslash\)": true, \(\backslash\)"pi\(\backslash\)": 3.141 \}"});}
\end{DoxyCode}


You can also get a string representation of a J\+S\+ON value (serialize)\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{\textcolor{comment}{// explicit conversion to string}}
\DoxyCodeLine{std::string s = j.\mbox{\hyperlink{classnlohmann_1_1basic__json_a50ec80b02d0f3f51130d4abb5d1cfdc5}{dump}}();    \textcolor{comment}{// \{\(\backslash\)"happy\(\backslash\)":true,\(\backslash\)"pi\(\backslash\)":3.141\}}}
\DoxyCodeLine{}
\DoxyCodeLine{\textcolor{comment}{// serialization with pretty printing}}
\DoxyCodeLine{\textcolor{comment}{// pass in the amount of spaces to indent}}
\DoxyCodeLine{std::cout << j.\mbox{\hyperlink{classnlohmann_1_1basic__json_a50ec80b02d0f3f51130d4abb5d1cfdc5}{dump}}(4) << std::endl;}
\DoxyCodeLine{\textcolor{comment}{// \{}}
\DoxyCodeLine{\textcolor{comment}{//     "happy": true,}}
\DoxyCodeLine{\textcolor{comment}{//     "pi": 3.141}}
\DoxyCodeLine{\textcolor{comment}{// \}}}
\end{DoxyCode}


Note the difference between serialization and assignment\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{\textcolor{comment}{// store a string in a JSON value}}
\DoxyCodeLine{\mbox{\hyperlink{classnlohmann_1_1basic__json}{json}} j\_string = \textcolor{stringliteral}{"this is a string"};}

\DoxyCodeLine{std::string serialized\_string = j\_string.\mbox{\hyperlink{classnlohmann_1_1basic__json_a50ec80b02d0f3f51130d4abb5d1cfdc5}{dump}}();}

Note the library only supports U\+T\+F-\/8. When you store strings with different encodings in the library, calling \href{https://nlohmann.github.io/json/classnlohmann_1_1basic__json_a50ec80b02d0f3f51130d4abb5d1cfdc5.html\#a50ec80b02d0f3f51130d4abb5d1cfdc5}{\texttt{ {\ttfamily dump()}}} may throw an exception unless {\ttfamily json\+::error\+\_\+handler\+\_\+t\+::replace} or {\ttfamily json\+::error\+\_\+handler\+\_\+t\+::ignore} are used as error handlers.\hypertarget{md_json-develop_README_autotoc_md149}{}\doxyparagraph{To/from streams (e.\+g. files, string streams)}\label{md_json-develop_README_autotoc_md149}
You can also use streams to serialize and deserialize\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{\textcolor{comment}{// deserialize from standard input}}
\DoxyCodeLine{\mbox{\hyperlink{classnlohmann_1_1basic__json}{json}} j;}
\DoxyCodeLine{std::cin >> j;}
\DoxyCodeLine{}
\DoxyCodeLine{\textcolor{comment}{// serialize to standard output}}
\DoxyCodeLine{std::cout << j;}
\DoxyCodeLine{}
\DoxyCodeLine{\textcolor{comment}{// the setw manipulator was overloaded to set the indentation for pretty printing}}
\DoxyCodeLine{std::cout << std::setw(4) << j << std::endl;}
\end{DoxyCode}


These operators work for any subclasses of {\ttfamily std\+::istream} or {\ttfamily std\+::ostream}. Here is the same example with files\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{\textcolor{comment}{// read a JSON file}}
\DoxyCodeLine{std::ifstream i(\textcolor{stringliteral}{"file.json"});}
\DoxyCodeLine{\mbox{\hyperlink{classnlohmann_1_1basic__json}{json}} j;}
\DoxyCodeLine{i >> j;}
\DoxyCodeLine{}
\DoxyCodeLine{\textcolor{comment}{// write prettified JSON to another file}}
\DoxyCodeLine{std::ofstream o(\textcolor{stringliteral}{"pretty.json"});}
\DoxyCodeLine{o << std::setw(4) << j << std::endl;}
\end{DoxyCode}


Please note that setting the exception bit for {\ttfamily failbit} is inappropriate for this use case. It will result in program termination due to the {\ttfamily noexcept} specifier in use.\hypertarget{md_json-develop_README_autotoc_md150}{}\doxyparagraph{Read from iterator range}\label{md_json-develop_README_autotoc_md150}
You can also parse J\+S\+ON from an iterator range; that is, from any container accessible by iterators whose content is stored as contiguous byte sequence, for instance a {\ttfamily std\+::vector$<$std\+::uint8\+\_\+t$>$}\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{std::vector<std::uint8\_t> v = \{\textcolor{charliteral}{'t'}, \textcolor{charliteral}{'r'}, \textcolor{charliteral}{'u'}, \textcolor{charliteral}{'e'}\};}
\DoxyCodeLine{\mbox{\hyperlink{classnlohmann_1_1basic__json}{json}} j = \mbox{\hyperlink{classnlohmann_1_1basic__json_a265a473e939184aa42655c9ccdf34e58}{json::parse}}(v.begin(), v.end());}
\end{DoxyCode}


You may leave the iterators for the range \mbox{[}begin, end)\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{std::vector<std::uint8\_t> v = \{\textcolor{charliteral}{'t'}, \textcolor{charliteral}{'r'}, \textcolor{charliteral}{'u'}, \textcolor{charliteral}{'e'}\};}
\DoxyCodeLine{\mbox{\hyperlink{classnlohmann_1_1basic__json}{json}} j = \mbox{\hyperlink{classnlohmann_1_1basic__json_a265a473e939184aa42655c9ccdf34e58}{json::parse}}(v);}
\end{DoxyCode}
\hypertarget{md_json-develop_README_autotoc_md151}{}\doxyparagraph{S\+A\+X interface}\label{md_json-develop_README_autotoc_md151}
The library uses a S\+A\+X-\/like interface with the following functions\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{\textcolor{comment}{// called when null is parsed}}
\DoxyCodeLine{\textcolor{keywordtype}{bool} \textcolor{keyword}{null}();}
\DoxyCodeLine{}
\DoxyCodeLine{\textcolor{comment}{// called when a boolean is parsed; value is passed}}
\DoxyCodeLine{\textcolor{keywordtype}{bool} \mbox{\hyperlink{namespacenlohmann_1_1detail_a1ed8fc6239da25abcaf681d30ace4985a84e2c64f38f78ba3ea5c905ab5a2da27}{boolean}}(\textcolor{keywordtype}{bool} val);}
\DoxyCodeLine{}
\DoxyCodeLine{\textcolor{comment}{// called when a signed or unsigned integer number is parsed; value is passed}}
\DoxyCodeLine{\textcolor{keywordtype}{bool} \mbox{\hyperlink{classnumber__integer}{number\_integer}}(number\_integer\_t val);}

\DoxyCodeLine{}
\DoxyCodeLine{\textcolor{comment}{// called when a floating-\/point number is parsed; value and original string is passed}}
\DoxyCodeLine{\textcolor{keywordtype}{bool} \mbox{\hyperlink{classnumber__float}{number\_float}}(number\_float\_t val, \textcolor{keyword}{const} string\_t\& s);}
\DoxyCodeLine{}
\DoxyCodeLine{\textcolor{comment}{// called when a string is parsed; value is passed and can be safely moved away}}
\DoxyCodeLine{\textcolor{keywordtype}{bool} \mbox{\hyperlink{classstring}{string}}(string\_t\& val);}
\DoxyCodeLine{}
\DoxyCodeLine{\textcolor{comment}{// called when an object or array begins or ends, resp. The number of elements is passed (or -\/1 if not known)}}
\DoxyCodeLine{\textcolor{keywordtype}{bool} start\_object(std::size\_t elements);}
\DoxyCodeLine{\textcolor{keywordtype}{bool} end\_object();}
\DoxyCodeLine{\textcolor{keywordtype}{bool} start\_array(std::size\_t elements);}
\DoxyCodeLine{\textcolor{keywordtype}{bool} end\_array();}
\DoxyCodeLine{\textcolor{comment}{// called when an object key is parsed; value is passed and can be safely moved away}}
\DoxyCodeLine{\textcolor{keywordtype}{bool} key(string\_t\& val);}
\DoxyCodeLine{}
\DoxyCodeLine{\textcolor{comment}{// called when a parse error occurs; byte position, the last token, and an exception is passed}}
\DoxyCodeLine{\textcolor{keywordtype}{bool} parse\_error(std::size\_t position, \textcolor{keyword}{const} std::string\& last\_token, \textcolor{keyword}{const} detail::exception\& ex);}
\end{DoxyCode}


The return value of each function determines whether parsing should proceed.

To implement your own S\+AX handler, proceed as follows\+:


\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item Implement the S\+AX interface in a class. You can use class {\ttfamily \mbox{\hyperlink{structnlohmann_1_1json__sax}{nlohmann\+::json\+\_\+sax}}$<$json$>$} as base class, but you can also use any class where the functions described above are implemented and public.
\item Create an object of your S\+AX interface class, e.\+g. {\ttfamily my\+\_\+sax}.
\item Call {\ttfamily bool json\+::sax\+\_\+parse(input, \&my\+\_\+sax)}; where the first parameter can be any input like a string or an input stream and the second parameter is a pointer to your S\+AX interface.
\end{DoxyEnumerate}

Note the {\ttfamily sax\+\_\+parse} function only returns a {\ttfamily bool} indicating the result of the last executed S\+AX event. It does not return a {\ttfamily json} value -\/ it is up to you to decide what to do with the S\+AX events. Furthermore, no exceptions are thrown in case of a parse error -\/ it is up to you what to do with the exception object passed to your {\ttfamily parse\+\_\+error} implementation. Internally, the S\+AX interface is used for the D\+OM parser (class {\ttfamily json\+\_\+sax\+\_\+dom\+\_\+parser}) as well as the acceptor ({\ttfamily json\+\_\+sax\+\_\+acceptor}), see file \href{https://github.com/nlohmann/json/blob/develop/include/nlohmann/detail/input/json_sax.hpp}{\texttt{ {\ttfamily json\+\_\+sax.\+hpp}}}.\hypertarget{md_json-develop_README_autotoc_md152}{}\doxysubsubsection{S\+T\+L-\/like access}\label{md_json-develop_README_autotoc_md152}
We designed the J\+S\+ON class to behave just like an S\+TL container. In fact, it satisfies the \href{https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/named_req/ReversibleContainer}{\texttt{ {\bfseries{Reversible\+Container}}}} requirement.

Any sequence container ({\ttfamily std\+::array}, {\ttfamily std\+::vector}, {\ttfamily std\+::deque}, {\ttfamily std\+::forward\+\_\+list}, {\ttfamily std\+::list}) whose values can be used to construct J\+S\+ON values (e.\+g., integers, floating point numbers, Booleans, string types, or again S\+TL containers described in this section) can be used to create a J\+S\+ON array. The same holds for similar associative containers ({\ttfamily std\+::set}, {\ttfamily std\+::multiset}, {\ttfamily std\+::unordered\+\_\+set}, {\ttfamily std\+::unordered\+\_\+multiset}), but in these cases the order of the elements of the array depends on how the elements are ordered in the respective S\+TL container.

Likewise, any associative key-\/value containers ({\ttfamily std\+::map}, {\ttfamily std\+::multimap}, {\ttfamily std\+::unordered\+\_\+map}, {\ttfamily std\+::unordered\+\_\+multimap}) whose keys can construct an {\ttfamily std\+::string} and whose values can be used to construct J\+S\+ON values (see examples above) can be used to create a J\+S\+ON object. Note that in case of multimaps only one key is used in the J\+S\+ON object and the value depends on the internal order of the S\+TL container.

That\textquotesingle{}s all! When calling the {\ttfamily json} constructor with your type, your custom {\ttfamily to\+\_\+json} method will be automatically called. Likewise, when calling {\ttfamily get$<$your\+\_\+type$>$()} or {\ttfamily get\+\_\+to(your\+\_\+type\&)}, the {\ttfamily from\+\_\+json} method will be called.

Some important things\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Those methods {\bfseries{M\+U\+ST}} be in your type\textquotesingle{}s namespace (which can be the global namespace), or the library will not be able to locate them (in this example, they are in namespace {\ttfamily ns}, where {\ttfamily person} is defined).
\item Those methods {\bfseries{M\+U\+ST}} be available (e.\+g., proper headers must be included) everywhere you use these conversions. Look at \href{https://github.com/nlohmann/json/issues/1108}{\texttt{ issue 1108}} for errors that may occur otherwise.
\item When using {\ttfamily get$<$your\+\_\+type$>$()}, {\ttfamily your\+\_\+type} {\bfseries{M\+U\+ST}} be \href{https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/named_req/DefaultConstructible}{\texttt{ Default\+Constructible}}. (There is a way to bypass this requirement described later.)
\item In function {\ttfamily from\+\_\+json}, use function \href{https://nlohmann.github.io/json/classnlohmann_1_1basic__json_a93403e803947b86f4da2d1fb3345cf2c.html\#a93403e803947b86f4da2d1fb3345cf2c}{\texttt{ {\ttfamily at()}}} to access the object values rather than {\ttfamily operator\mbox{[}\mbox{]}}. In case a key does not exist, {\ttfamily at} throws an exception that you can handle, whereas {\ttfamily operator\mbox{[}\mbox{]}} exhibits undefined behavior.
\item You do not need to add serializers or deserializers for S\+TL types like {\ttfamily std\+::vector}\+: the library already implements these.
\end{DoxyItemize}\hypertarget{md_json-develop_README_autotoc_md159}{}\doxyparagraph{How do I convert third-\/party types?}\label{md_json-develop_README_autotoc_md159}
This requires a bit more advanced technique. But first, let\textquotesingle{}s see how this conversion mechanism works\+:

The library uses {\bfseries{J\+S\+ON Serializers}} to convert types to json. The default serializer for {\ttfamily \mbox{\hyperlink{namespacenlohmann_a9cc9a3033850a092f791d86854d117fc}{nlohmann\+::json}}} is {\ttfamily \mbox{\hyperlink{structnlohmann_1_1adl__serializer}{nlohmann\+::adl\+\_\+serializer}}} (A\+DL means \href{https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/adl}{\texttt{ Argument-\/\+Dependent Lookup}}).

It is implemented like this (simplified)\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{\textcolor{keyword}{template} <\textcolor{keyword}{typename} T>}
\DoxyCodeLine{\textcolor{keyword}{struct }adl\_serializer \{}
\DoxyCodeLine{    \textcolor{keyword}{static} \textcolor{keywordtype}{void} to\_json(\mbox{\hyperlink{classnlohmann_1_1basic__json}{json}}\& j, \textcolor{keyword}{const} T\& value) \{}
\DoxyCodeLine{        \textcolor{comment}{// calls the "to\_json" method in T's namespace}}
\DoxyCodeLine{    \}}
\DoxyCodeLine{}
\DoxyCodeLine{    \textcolor{keyword}{static} \textcolor{keywordtype}{void} from\_json(\textcolor{keyword}{const} \mbox{\hyperlink{classnlohmann_1_1basic__json}{json}}\& j, T\& value) \{}
\DoxyCodeLine{        \textcolor{comment}{// same thing, but with the "from\_json" method}}
\DoxyCodeLine{    \}}
\DoxyCodeLine{\};}
\end{DoxyCode}


This serializer works fine when you have control over the type\textquotesingle{}s namespace. However, what about {\ttfamily boost\+::optional} or {\ttfamily std\+::filesystem\+::path} (C++17)? Hijacking the {\ttfamily boost} namespace is pretty bad, and it\textquotesingle{}s illegal to add something other than template specializations to {\ttfamily std}...

To solve this, you need to add a specialization of {\ttfamily adl\+\_\+serializer} to the {\ttfamily nlohmann} namespace, here\textquotesingle{}s an example\+:

There is a way, if your type is \href{https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/named_req/MoveConstructible}{\texttt{ Move\+Constructible}}. You will need to specialize the {\ttfamily adl\+\_\+serializer} as well, but with a special {\ttfamily from\+\_\+json} overload\+:

\hypertarget{md_json-develop_README_autotoc_md161}{}\doxyparagraph{Can I write my own serializer? (\+Advanced use)}\label{md_json-develop_README_autotoc_md161}
Yes. You might want to take a look at \href{https://github.com/nlohmann/json/blob/develop/test/src/unit-udt.cpp}{\texttt{ {\ttfamily unit-\/udt.\+cpp}}} in the test suite, to see a few examples.

If you write your own serializer, you\textquotesingle{}ll need to do a few things\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item use a different {\ttfamily basic\+\_\+json} alias than {\ttfamily \mbox{\hyperlink{namespacenlohmann_a9cc9a3033850a092f791d86854d117fc}{nlohmann\+::json}}} (the last template parameter of {\ttfamily basic\+\_\+json} is the {\ttfamily J\+S\+O\+N\+Serializer})
\item use your {\ttfamily basic\+\_\+json} alias (or a template parameter) in all your {\ttfamily to\+\_\+json}/{\ttfamily from\+\_\+json} methods
\item use {\ttfamily nlohmann\+::to\+\_\+json} and {\ttfamily nlohmann\+::from\+\_\+json} when you need A\+DL
\end{DoxyItemize}

Here is an example, without simplifications, that only accepts types with a size $<$= 32, and uses A\+DL.


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{\textcolor{comment}{// You should use void as a second template argument}}
\DoxyCodeLine{\textcolor{comment}{// if you don't need compile-\/time checks on T}}
\DoxyCodeLine{\textcolor{keyword}{template}<\textcolor{keyword}{typename} T, \textcolor{keyword}{typename} SFINAE = \textcolor{keyword}{typename} std::enable\_if<sizeof(T) <= 32>::type>}
\DoxyCodeLine{struct less\_than\_32\_serializer \{}
\DoxyCodeLine{    \textcolor{keyword}{template} <\textcolor{keyword}{typename} BasicJsonType>}
\DoxyCodeLine{    \textcolor{keyword}{static} \textcolor{keywordtype}{void} to\_json(BasicJsonType\& j, T value) \{}
\DoxyCodeLine{        \textcolor{comment}{// we want to use ADL, and call the correct to\_json overload}}
\DoxyCodeLine{        \textcolor{keyword}{using} nlohmann::to\_json; \textcolor{comment}{// this method is called by adl\_serializer,}}
\DoxyCodeLine{                                 \textcolor{comment}{// this is where the magic happens}}
\DoxyCodeLine{        to\_json(j, value);}

\hypertarget{md_json-develop_README_autotoc_md162}{}\doxysubsubsection{Specializing enum conversion}\label{md_json-develop_README_autotoc_md162}
By default, enum values are serialized to J\+S\+ON as integers. In some cases this could result in undesired behavior. If an enum is modified or re-\/ordered after data has been serialized to J\+S\+ON, the later de-\/serialized J\+S\+ON data may be undefined or a different enum value than was originally intended.

It is possible to more precisely specify how a given enum is mapped to and from J\+S\+ON as shown below\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{\textcolor{comment}{// example enum type declaration}}
\DoxyCodeLine{\textcolor{keyword}{enum} TaskState \{}

The {\ttfamily N\+L\+O\+H\+M\+A\+N\+N\+\_\+\+J\+S\+O\+N\+\_\+\+S\+E\+R\+I\+A\+L\+I\+Z\+E\+\_\+\+E\+N\+U\+M()} macro declares a set of {\ttfamily to\+\_\+json()} / {\ttfamily from\+\_\+json()} functions for type {\ttfamily Task\+State} while avoiding repetition and boilerplate serialization code.

{\bfseries{Usage\+:}}


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{\textcolor{comment}{// enum to JSON as string}}
\DoxyCodeLine{\mbox{\hyperlink{classnlohmann_1_1basic__json}{json}} j = TS\_STOPPED;}

\end{DoxyCode}


Just as in \href{\#arbitrary-types-conversions}{\texttt{ Arbitrary Type Conversions}} above,
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily N\+L\+O\+H\+M\+A\+N\+N\+\_\+\+J\+S\+O\+N\+\_\+\+S\+E\+R\+I\+A\+L\+I\+Z\+E\+\_\+\+E\+N\+U\+M()} M\+U\+ST be declared in your enum type\textquotesingle{}s namespace (which can be the global namespace), or the library will not be able to locate it and it will default to integer serialization.
\item It M\+U\+ST be available (e.\+g., proper headers must be included) everywhere you use the conversions.
\end{DoxyItemize}

Other Important points\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item When using {\ttfamily get$<$E\+N\+U\+M\+\_\+\+T\+Y\+PE$>$()}, undefined J\+S\+ON values will default to the first pair specified in your map. Select this default pair carefully.
\item If an enum or J\+S\+ON value is specified more than once in your map, the first matching occurrence from the top of the map will be returned when converting to or from J\+S\+ON.
\end{DoxyItemize}\hypertarget{md_json-develop_README_autotoc_md163}{}\doxysubsubsection{Binary formats (\+B\+S\+O\+N, C\+B\+O\+R, Message\+Pack, and U\+B\+J\+S\+O\+N)}\label{md_json-develop_README_autotoc_md163}
Though J\+S\+ON is a ubiquitous data format, it is not a very compact format suitable for data exchange, for instance over a network. Hence, the library supports~\href{http://bsonspec.org}{\texttt{ B\+S\+ON}} (Binary J\+S\+ON), \href{http://cbor.io}{\texttt{ C\+B\+OR}} (Concise Binary Object Representation), \href{http://msgpack.org}{\texttt{ Message\+Pack}}, and \href{http://ubjson.org}{\texttt{ U\+B\+J\+S\+ON}} (Universal Binary J\+S\+ON Specification) to efficiently encode J\+S\+ON values to byte vectors and to decode such vectors.

\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item G\+CC 4.\+8 -\/ 9.\+2 (and possibly later)
\item Clang 3.\+4 -\/ 9.\+0 (and possibly later)

\end{DoxyItemize}

I would be happy to learn about other compilers/versions.

Please note\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item G\+CC 4.\+8 has a bug \href{https://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=57824}{\texttt{ 57824}})\+: multiline raw strings cannot be the arguments to macros. Don\textquotesingle{}t use multiline raw strings directly in macros with this compiler.
\item Android defaults to using very old compilers and C++ libraries. To fix this, add the following to your {\ttfamily Application.\+mk}. This will switch to the L\+L\+VM C++ library, the Clang compiler, and enable C++11 and other features disabled by default.

\`{}\`{}\`{} A\+P\+P\+\_\+\+S\+TL \+:= c++\+\_\+shared N\+D\+K\+\_\+\+T\+O\+O\+L\+C\+H\+A\+I\+N\+\_\+\+V\+E\+R\+S\+I\+ON \+:= clang3.\+6 A\+P\+P\+\_\+\+C\+P\+P\+F\+L\+A\+GS += -\/frtti -\/fexceptions \`{}\`{}\`{}

The code compiles successfully with \href{https://developer.android.com/ndk/index.html?hl=ml}{\texttt{ Android N\+DK}}, Revision 9 -\/ 11 (and possibly later) and \href{https://www.crystax.net/en/android/ndk}{\texttt{ CrystaX\textquotesingle{}s Android N\+DK}} version 10.
\item For G\+CC running on Min\+GW or Android S\+DK, the error `\textquotesingle{}to\+\_\+string' is not a member of \textquotesingle{}std\textquotesingle{}{\ttfamily (or similarly, for}strtod{\ttfamily ) may occur. Note this is not an issue with the code, but rather with the compiler itself. On Android, see above to build with a newer environment. For Min\+GW, please refer to \mbox{[}this site\mbox{]}(\href{http://tehsausage.com/mingw-to-string}{\texttt{ http\+://tehsausage.\+com/mingw-\/to-\/string}}) and \mbox{[}this discussion\mbox{]}(\href{https://github.com/nlohmann/json/issues/136}{\texttt{ https\+://github.\+com/nlohmann/json/issues/136}}) for information on how to fix this bug.

\item Unsupported versions of G\+CC and Clang are rejected by {\ttfamily \#error} directives. This can be switched off by defining {\ttfamily J\+S\+O\+N\+\_\+\+S\+K\+I\+P\+\_\+\+U\+N\+S\+U\+P\+P\+O\+R\+T\+E\+D\+\_\+\+C\+O\+M\+P\+I\+L\+E\+R\+\_\+\+C\+H\+E\+CK}.

The library is currently used in Apple mac\+OS Sierra and i\+OS 10. I am not sure what they are using the library for, but I am happy that it runs on so many devices.\hypertarget{md_json-develop_README_autotoc_md171}{}\doxysubsection{Notes}\label{md_json-develop_README_autotoc_md171}
\hypertarget{md_json-develop_README_autotoc_md172}{}\doxysubsubsection{Character encoding}\label{md_json-develop_README_autotoc_md172}
The library supports {\bfseries{Unicode input}} as follows\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Only {\bfseries{U\+T\+F-\/8}} encoded input is supported which is the default encoding for J\+S\+ON according to \href{https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8259.html\#section-8.1}{\texttt{ R\+FC 8259}}.
\item {\ttfamily std\+::u16string} and {\ttfamily std\+::u32string} can be parsed, assuming U\+T\+F-\/16 and U\+T\+F-\/32 encoding, respectively. These encodings are not supported when reading from files or other input containers.
\item Other encodings such as Latin-\/1 or I\+SO 8859-\/1 are {\bfseries{not}} supported and will yield parse or serialization errors.
\item \href{http://www.unicode.org/faq/private_use.html\#nonchar1}{\texttt{ Unicode noncharacters}} will not be replaced by the library.
\item Invalid surrogates (e.\+g., incomplete pairs such as {\ttfamily \textbackslash{}u\+D\+E\+AD}) will yield parse errors.
\item The strings stored in the library are U\+T\+F-\/8 encoded. When using the default string type ({\ttfamily std\+::string}), note that its length/size functions return the number of stored bytes rather than the number of characters or glyphs.
\item When you store strings with different encodings in the library, calling \href{https://nlohmann.github.io/json/classnlohmann_1_1basic__json_a50ec80b02d0f3f51130d4abb5d1cfdc5.html\#a50ec80b02d0f3f51130d4abb5d1cfdc5}{\texttt{ {\ttfamily dump()}}} may throw an exception unless {\ttfamily json\+::error\+\_\+handler\+\_\+t\+::replace} or {\ttfamily json\+::error\+\_\+handler\+\_\+t\+::ignore} are used as error handlers.
\end{DoxyItemize}\hypertarget{md_json-develop_README_autotoc_md173}{}\doxysubsubsection{Comments in J\+S\+ON}\label{md_json-develop_README_autotoc_md173}
This library does not support comments. It does so for three reasons\+:


\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item Comments are not part of the \href{https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8259}{\texttt{ J\+S\+ON specification}}. You may argue that {\ttfamily //} or {\ttfamily /$\ast$ $\ast$/} are allowed in Java\+Script, but J\+S\+ON is not Java\+Script.
\item This was not an oversight\+: Douglas Crockford \href{https://plus.google.com/118095276221607585885/posts/RK8qyGVaGSr}{\texttt{ wrote on this}} in May 2012\+:

$>$ I removed comments from J\+S\+ON because I saw people were using them to hold parsing directives, a practice which would have destroyed interoperability. I know that the lack of comments makes some people sad, but it shouldn\textquotesingle{}t.

$>$ Suppose you are using J\+S\+ON to keep configuration files, which you would like to annotate. Go ahead and insert all the comments you like. Then pipe it through J\+S\+Min before handing it to your J\+S\+ON parser.
\item It is dangerous for interoperability if some libraries would add comment support while others don\textquotesingle{}t. Please check \href{https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-iab-protocol-maintenance-01}{\texttt{ The Harmful Consequences of the Robustness Principle}} on this.
\end{DoxyEnumerate}

This library will not support comments in the future. If you wish to use comments, I see three options\+:


\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item Strip comments before using this library.
\item Use a different J\+S\+ON library with comment support.
\item Use a format that natively supports comments (e.\+g., Y\+A\+ML or J\+S\+O\+N5).
\end{DoxyEnumerate}\hypertarget{md_json-develop_README_autotoc_md174}{}\doxysubsubsection{Order of object keys}\label{md_json-develop_README_autotoc_md174}
By default, the library does not preserve the {\bfseries{insertion order of object elements}}. This is standards-\/compliant, as the \href{https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8259.html}{\texttt{ J\+S\+ON standard}} defines objects as \char`\"{}an unordered collection of zero or more name/value pairs\char`\"{}. If you do want to preserve the insertion order, you can specialize the object type with containers like \href{https://github.com/Tessil/ordered-map}{\texttt{ {\ttfamily tsl\+::ordered\+\_\+map}}} (\href{https://github.com/nlohmann/json/issues/546\#issuecomment-304447518}{\texttt{ integration}}) or \href{https://github.com/nlohmann/fifo_map}{\texttt{ {\ttfamily nlohmann\+::fifo\+\_\+map}}} (\href{https://github.com/nlohmann/json/issues/485\#issuecomment-333652309}{\texttt{ integration}}).\hypertarget{md_json-develop_README_autotoc_md175}{}\doxysubsubsection{Further notes}\label{md_json-develop_README_autotoc_md175}

\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item The code contains numerous debug {\bfseries{assertions}} which can be switched off by defining the preprocessor macro {\ttfamily N\+D\+E\+B\+UG}, see the \href{https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/error/assert}{\texttt{ documentation of {\ttfamily assert}}}. In particular, note \href{https://nlohmann.github.io/json/classnlohmann_1_1basic__json_a233b02b0839ef798942dd46157cc0fe6.html\#a233b02b0839ef798942dd46157cc0fe6}{\texttt{ {\ttfamily operator\mbox{[}\mbox{]}}}} implements {\bfseries{unchecked access}} for const objects\+: If the given key is not present, the behavior is undefined (think of a dereferenced null pointer) and yields an \href{https://github.com/nlohmann/json/issues/289}{\texttt{ assertion failure}} if assertions are switched on. If you are not sure whether an element in an object exists, use checked access with the \href{https://nlohmann.github.io/json/classnlohmann_1_1basic__json_a73ae333487310e3302135189ce8ff5d8.html\#a73ae333487310e3302135189ce8ff5d8}{\texttt{ {\ttfamily at()} function}}.
\item As the exact type of a number is not defined in the \href{https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8259.html}{\texttt{ J\+S\+ON specification}}, this library tries to choose the best fitting C++ number type automatically. As a result, the type {\ttfamily double} may be used to store numbers which may yield \href{https://github.com/nlohmann/json/issues/181}{\texttt{ {\bfseries{floating-\/point exceptions}}}} in certain rare situations if floating-\/point exceptions have been unmasked in the calling code. These exceptions are not caused by the library and need to be fixed in the calling code, such as by re-\/masking the exceptions prior to calling library functions.
\item The code can be compiled without C++ {\bfseries{runtime type identification}} features; that is, you can use the {\ttfamily -\/fno-\/rtti} compiler flag.
\item {\bfseries{Exceptions}} are used widely within the library. They can, however, be switched off with either using the compiler flag {\ttfamily -\/fno-\/exceptions} or by defining the symbol {\ttfamily J\+S\+O\+N\+\_\+\+N\+O\+E\+X\+C\+E\+P\+T\+I\+ON}. In this case, exceptions are replaced by {\ttfamily abort()} calls. You can further control this behavior by defining {\ttfamily J\+S\+O\+N\+\_\+\+T\+H\+R\+O\+W\+\_\+\+U\+S\+E\+R´} (overriding {\ttfamily throw}), {\ttfamily J\+S\+O\+N\+\_\+\+T\+R\+Y\+\_\+\+U\+S\+ER} (overriding {\ttfamily try}), and {\ttfamily J\+S\+O\+N\+\_\+\+C\+A\+T\+C\+H\+\_\+\+U\+S\+ER} (overriding {\ttfamily catch}). Note that {\ttfamily J\+S\+O\+N\+\_\+\+T\+H\+R\+O\+W\+\_\+\+U\+S\+ER} should leave the current scope (e.\+g., by throwing or aborting), as continuing after it may yield undefined behavior.
