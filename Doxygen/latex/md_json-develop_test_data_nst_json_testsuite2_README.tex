A comprehensive test suite for R\+FC 8259 compliant J\+S\+ON parsers

This repository was created as an appendix to the article \href{http://seriot.ch/parsing_json.php}{\texttt{ Parsing J\+S\+ON is a Minefield ðŸ’£}}.

$\ast$$\ast$/parsers/$\ast$$\ast$

This directory contains several parsers and tiny wrappers to turn the parsers into J\+S\+ON validators, by returning a specific value.


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily 0} the parser did accept the content
\item {\ttfamily 1} the parser did reject the content
\item {\ttfamily $>$1} the process did crash
\item {\ttfamily timeout} happens after 5 seconds
\end{DoxyItemize}

$\ast$$\ast$/test\+\_\+parsing/$\ast$$\ast$

The name of these files tell if their contents should be accepted or rejected.


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily y\+\_\+} content must be accepted by parsers
\item {\ttfamily n\+\_\+} content must be rejected by parsers
\item {\ttfamily i\+\_\+} parsers are free to accept or reject content
\end{DoxyItemize}

$\ast$$\ast$/test\+\_\+transform/$\ast$$\ast$

These files contain weird structures and characters that parsers may understand differently, eg\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item huge numbers
\item dictionaries with similar keys
\item N\+U\+LL characters
\item escaped invalid strings
\end{DoxyItemize}

These files were used to produce {\ttfamily results/transform.\+html}.

$\ast$$\ast$/run\+\_\+tests.py$\ast$$\ast$

Run all parsers with all files\+: \begin{DoxyVerb}$ python3 run_tests.py
\end{DoxyVerb}


Run all parsers with a specific file\+: \begin{DoxyVerb}$ python3 run_tests.py file.json
\end{DoxyVerb}


Run specific parsers with all files\+: \begin{DoxyVerb}$ echo '["Python 2.7.10", "Python 3.5.2"]' > python_only.json
$ python3 run_tests.py --filter=python_only.json
\end{DoxyVerb}


The script writes logs in {\ttfamily results/logs.\+txt}.

The script then reads {\ttfamily logs.\+txt} and generates {\ttfamily results/parsing.\+html}.
